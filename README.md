# üè∑Ô∏è Garage sale app

Simple garage sale app that I built using Nuxt. Nuxt Content made managing the content (via `/content/products/*` Markdown files) a breeze!

Feel free to fork this and use it for your own garage sales ‚Äî just don't forget to update analytics and remove any other personal information that I have added.

The app includes a show page per item with an image gallery.
